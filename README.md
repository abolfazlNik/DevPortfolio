# Portfolio

This portfolio has been designed and developed by myself to showcase my experiences and demonstrate my capabilities. It is a substantial project built using Next.js and TypeScript, incorporating GSAP and Lenis for animations. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, Zod for form validation, and React Hook Form for form management. Additionally, Zustand is utilized for state management.
